			caesar README

caesar is:

caesar.py: a python module with some functions providing a simple substitution cipher.

encipher.py: a command line tool providing easy encipherment using the caesar module.

decipher.py   a command line tool providing easy decipherment using the caesar module.

test_caesar.py - a test suite for caesar.py

To use the utilities, the syntax is:

<source> [<destination>]

<source> is what you want to decipher or encipher. It might be a file or some text enclosed in single quotes. <destination> is an optional filename to use as an output destination.

You will be asked for a key. This is an integer between 0 and 25.

If you do not provide a key for encipherment, one will be chosen at random for you.

If you do not know the key for decipherment, an attempt will be made to find it for you.

WARNING!

In case it was not already blindingly obvious, this software is almost completely useless. It is provided only for fun and learning.

DO NOT, under any circumstances whatsoever, use this cipher to protect any data you actually care about protecting. It provides probably the weakest protection possible.

Thank you!
